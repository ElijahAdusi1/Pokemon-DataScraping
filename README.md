# Newbie Datascraping Pokemon project
My first ever data scraping project using beautifulsoup4, numpy, requests, seaborne and matplotlib.
This was originally created in September 2021, but I only just uploaded it to github in June 2022.
I have attached a json file of the data I gathered.
UPDATE: I have updated this data to include the latest generation as well as changed some of the functions used to gather the data
I also have attached a CSV file, which is available here.
Feedback and tips are greatly appriciated. You can email me at elijahadusi@gmail.com
